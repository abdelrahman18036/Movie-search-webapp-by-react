# Movie search webapp by react
Basically, the app will be able to search for movies via the OMDB API and render the results to the user. The reason for building the app is just so that we can get a better understanding of using hooks in an application, which helps in understanding the role some of the hooks we will use can play in your own real-world apps. Some things are needed before we get into building the app:
Node (≥ 6)
A cool text Editor
An API key from OMDB (You can obtain it here or use mine)
Great, once we have that then the next step is to set up the React app. For this tutorial we will be using create-react-app — it’s a really awesome tool for setting up a React app without having to deal with all the configurations that come with starting from scratch.
